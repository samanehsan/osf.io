                            <div class="support-body">The OSF is maintained and developed by the <a href="http://cos.io">Center for Open Science</a> (COS), a non-profit organization.

                            <div class="support-body">Data stored on the OSF is backed by a $250,000 preservation fund that will provide for persistence of your data, even if the Center for Open Science runs out of funding. The code base for the OSF is entirely <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io">open source</a>, which enables other groups to continue maintaining and expanding it if we aren’t able to.</div>

                            <div class="support-body">The OSF integrates with the scientist's daily workflow. The OSF helps document and archive study designs, materials, and data. The OSF facilitates sharing of materials and data within a laboratory or across laboratories. The OSF also facilitates transparency of laboratory research and provides a network design that details and credits individual contributions for all aspects of the research process. To see how it works, watch our short <a href="/getting-started">Getting Started</a> videos, see the <a href="https://osf.io/4znZP/wiki/home">OSF Features</a> page, or see how other scientists <a href="https://osf.io/svje2/">use the OSF.</a></div>

                            <div class="support-body">The best way to create a lab or organizational group on the OSF is to create a project for that group. Then, individual projects within the lab can either be organized into components of the lab project or into their own projects which are linked to the lab group project. For an example, check out the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project: Psychology.</a></div>

                            <div class="support-body">The OSF supports many third-party add-ons. For storage, you can connect to Amazon S3, Box, Dataverse, Dropbox, Figshare, Github, and Google Drive, and the OSF has its own default storage add-on, OSF Storage, if you choose not to connect to any third-party add-ons. The OSF also supports Mendeley and Zotero as citation managers. Please refer to the helpful <a href="/getting-started/#addons">Add-ons section</a> of our Getting Started page for more information on how to use add-ons.</div>

                            <div class="support-body">A registration is a frozen version of your project that can never be edited or deleted, but you can issue a retraction of it later, leaving behind basic metadata. When you create the registration, you have the option of either making it public immediately or making it private for up to four years through an embargo. A registration is useful for certifying what you did in a project in advance of data analysis, or for confirming the exact state of the project at important points of the lifecycle, such as manuscript submission or the onset of data collection.</div>

                                The OSF is designed to support both private and public workflows. You can
                                keep projects, or individual components of projects, private so that only
                                your project collaborators have access to them.</div>

                            <h5 class="support-head f-w-xl"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> How secure is my information?</h5>
                            <div class="support-body">Security is extremely important for
                                the OSF. When you sign up and create a password, your password is not
                                recorded. Instead, we store a <a href="http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/">bcrypt
                                    hash</a> of your password. This is a computation on your password that
                                cannot be reversed, but is the same every time it is computed from your
                                password. This provides extra security. No one but you can know your
                                password. When you click "Forgot your password," the OSF sends you a new random
                                password because it neither stores nor has the ability to compute your password.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Data and materials posted on the OSF are not yet encrypted, unless you encrypt
                                them before uploading to the site. This means that if our servers were
                                compromised, the intruder would have access to raw data. While we have taken
                                technological measures to minimize this risk, the level of security can be
                                improved further. We will offer encryption soon, and we will partner with
                                data storage services that offer strong security features.</div>

                                <p>Rackspace and Amazon Glacier have their own methods to support data integrity (e.g., redundancy across 5+ locations), but the Open Science Framework takes the extra step of calculating multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksums</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive">parity archives</a> to account for even the most improbable errors.</p>
