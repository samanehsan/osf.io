<p class="gs-header">View-only Links</p>
<p>View-only links can be created for sharing your private projects or components so that people can view - but not edit - them. These links can be anonymized, to remove contributors' names from the project and associated logs, for use in blinded peer review. </p>
<p>To create a view-only link, click on the "Sharing" tab, and scroll down to the "View-only links" section. Click "create a link," give the link a name, and chose the project or component(s) you'd like to link to.</p>
