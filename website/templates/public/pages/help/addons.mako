<p class="gs-header">Add-Ons</p>
 <p>The OSF makes integrating your various research workflows easy. We are always developing Add-On connections to services you already use. 
 </p>
 <p> Some Add-Ons can be added to the entire user account, like Two-Factor Authentication. To access these, navigate to your user settings using the gear in the top right corner. Then select "Configure Add-Ons". Here you can choose which Add-Ons to apply. 
 </p>
 <p> Other Add-Ons only apply to individual projects. The wiki and external links Add-On are examples of this. They can only be accessed and applied from your project's settings. </p>
 
<p>Most Add-Ons require both account authentication as well as project application. The easiest way to do this is directly from the project page. First, navigate to the project's settings. Then select the Add-Ons that you want to incorporate into your project. A pop-up with information about the Add-On will show up, click okay, and then click submit. </p>

<p>After clicking submit, you will notice a box labled "Configure Add-Ons" beneath the "Select Add-Ons" box. Go to the "Configure Add-Ons" box and create an access token for the Add-On, this authorizes the Add-On for the entire OSF account. Then configure the Add-On and click submit to apply the Add-On to the individual project. Once you've authorized an Add-On, you never have to do it again. However, you always need to apply the Add-On to your individual projects. </p>
